{"name":"First Post","tagline":"dgplug","body":"### Welcome to My GitHub Pages.\r\nWelcome all, This is my first blog post. I have signed up myself to #dgplug summer training. Unlike most of the students attending this course, I am not a student. I am a working professional, working as a support engineer. I would like to tickle my coding instincts and thankfully I landed into dgplug's summer training. Folks at this summer training are doing a great job in educating folks about the need of opensource and the need to contribute towards it. \r\nI hope I keep myself commited for this training session and hopefully one day I contribute to opensource projects. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
